# **Anti-Money Laundering Detection Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect anti-money laundering (AML) activities in the banking industry. The solution involves data gathering, storage, processing, cleaning, and model training. Additionally, a user-friendly interface is created using Streamlit to make the model easily accessible for testing and deployment.

---

## **Features**  
- Automated detection of suspicious financial activities.
- Handles data ingestion, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- Provides interpretable results to detect anomalies.
- Built-in visualization tools for exploratory data analysis.
- Streamlit app for seamless interaction.

---

## **Workflow**  
1. **Data Gathering**  
   - Data was collected from anonymized banking transactions that include attributes such as transaction amounts, customer profiles, account types, transaction locations, timestamps, and flagged suspicious activities.
   - External datasets (e.g., from regulatory bodies or public AML datasets) were incorporated for training and testing.

2. **Data Storage**  
   - The raw data is stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
   - Processed datasets are stored in `.csv` format for efficient loading.

3. **Data Processing and Cleaning**  
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Missing entries were imputed using statistical techniques such as mean/mode imputation or removed if the missingness was significant.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Extreme values were detected using interquartile ranges (IQR) and replaced or flagged.
   - **Normalization/Scaling**: Numerical features were normalized to ensure uniformity.
   - **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoding and label encoding were applied to categorical variables.
   - **Feature Selection**: Correlation analysis and domain knowledge were used to select relevant features.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized transaction distributions, customer demographics, and flagged transactions.
   - Used tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for insightful graphs.

5. **Model Development**  
   - Various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.) were evaluated.
   - Final model: **[Specify the chosen model, e.g., XGBoost or Random Forest]**.
   - The model is trained on features such as transaction frequency, amount, location anomaly, and historical flagged patterns.

6. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC were used to evaluate model performance.
   - Confusion Matrix provided insights into True Positives and False Positives.

7. **Deployment**  
   - A **Streamlit** application was developed to deploy the AML model.
   - Users can upload transaction datasets, visualize the analysis, and receive predictions.

## **Streamlit Application**  
The Streamlit app provides the following functionalities:  
1. **Upload Data**: Users can upload `.csv` files for analysis.  
2. **EDA Dashboard**: Interactive visualizations for understanding transaction patterns.  
3. **Prediction**: Detect whether a transaction is suspicious or not based on the model.  
4. **Detailed Insights**: Displays reasons behind a flagged transaction using feature importance.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
